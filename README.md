# 📡 WV-System-ID-Overview

**WV-System-ID-Overview** is an actively maintained reference of **Widevine CDM (Content Decryption Module) System IDs** across various devices and platforms. This repository serves as a centralized, searchable, and structured index of known Widevine-enabled devices — including key details such as their **Security Level**, **OEM identifiers**, and **provisioning behavior** (when available).

## 💡 Purpose

This project supports **researchers, developers, and security analysts** by:

- 🧩 Documenting real-world `system_id` values used in Widevine CDMs
- 🏷️ Categorizing devices by security level: `L1`, `L2`, and `L3`
- 🚫 Tracking deprecated, revoked, or unknown CDM types
- 🔍 Providing insights into provisioning, revocation behavior, and device capabilities
